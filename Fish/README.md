Relenting before the tyranny of Python's virtual environment system, and 
the Python dictator who believes any other design an "anti-pattern,"
you shall configure the Fish game environment for usage by running
the script located in the directory of this README.

The script goes by the name of fisghame and it has two options.

./fishgame --activate

This will install the dependencies of Fish! and allow
you to run the unit and integration tests of Fish!


./fishgame --deactivate

Since it would be rude to leave them installed on your system
after a fun session of checking out the code in here,
the above command will remove the libraries I installed
to your Python.
